The `Frame` tag specifies the transformation of the link frame w.r.t. the base frame. When this transformation is identity, the error of the task is zero. See the [documentation](https://ipab-slmc.github.io/exotica/overview.html#system-model) for full description of the frame conventions. This task map defines the transformation of the `lwr_arm_6_link` with an additional offset w.r.t. the `Target` frame, i.e., the error is zero when the end-effector (link 6) coincides with the target frame.
