    "# Exercise\n",
    "In this exercise you will learn how to do trajectory optimisation using the Approximate Inference COntrol algorithm ([AICO](https://www.icml.cc/Conferences/2009/papers/271.pdf)).\n",
    "The AICO algoritm is designed to solve a `UnconstrainedTimeIndexedProblem`. Similarly to the `UnconstrainedEdnPoseProblem` it defines a cost minimisation problem. However, the cost is minimized across an uniformly discretized trajectory. There is `T` number of timesteps spaced uniformly with at time intervals `tau` apart (`tau` would often be called `dt`). The task maps get updated for each time step and the task stores a vector of scaling factors `rho`. You can create complex transitions by tweaking the scaling factors for each task at every timestep separately.\n",

    "The weights `rho` can be set separately for each time step. A common setup is to set the weights to zero when a certain task does not need to be active. Below is an example of the end-effector frame tracking being ignored for the first 0.8s of the trajectory. Then the end-effector tracks the target (figure eight) with high precision (`1e5`). The solver doesn't have to minimise any cost for the 0.8s of the trajectory so it is only minimising the control effort. This setup will produce a smooth transition towards the target location before starting the treacking."
